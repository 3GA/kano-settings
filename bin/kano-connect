# desc: This script attempts to find an open wireless network and connect to it.
#       Additionally it is capable of reconnecting to secure networks associated to by kwifiprompt.
#
# usage:
#
#   Case 1: Attempt connection to the strongest wireless non-secure network
#   $ sudo kanoconnect.py wlan0
#
#   Case 2: Attempt connection to a specified open network
#   $ sudo kanoconnect.py wlan0 essidname
#
#   Case 3: If the last cached network is found during scan, try to connect to it (secure / unsecure / hidden)
#   $ sudo kanoconnect.py -c wlan0
#
# It might take some time for this script to finalise, depending on the wireless networks
# in range, their signal strenght and response times to acquire a DHCP lease.
#
# Portions of this code are extracted from the project pywilist:
#
#   https://code.google.com/p/pywilist/
#
# The script needs root permissions. It is good to trigger it from
# /etc/network/interfaces post-up event.
