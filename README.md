Kano Settings is like a Swiss Army knife: crammed with lots of useful applications, all conveniently packaged together for ease of use and topped off with a lovely UI. Itâ€™s a great tool, especially for beginners, to get started quickly without having to tinker with different config files. Set up your wifi, keyboard, mouse, audio, display, account, wallpaper, and overclock your Raspberry Pi, all with one handy utility.

## Settings


### Keyboard

This setting configures the keyboard given a country and a variant.

### Mouse

Configuration of the mouse speed: low, normal and high.

### Audio

Audio output can be set to Analog (speaker or headphones) or HDMI (tv).

### Display

The resolution of the display can be configured from this setting. The list of modes offered depend directly on the screen/monitor used.

If your screen requires special settings or lacks EDID information and you need to manually set them,
create a file in the boot partition as well with the name `no-config-writes`. This will tell Kano OS not to try to optimize
your modes or resolution.

### WiFi

Tool to configure your internet connection: ethernet, wifi or smartphone USB tethering.

### Overclocking

Get the most of your RaspberryPi. Choose from None, Modest, Medium or High.

### Account

Change your password, remove your account or add a new one.

### Wallpaper

Select a wallpaper for your desktop.
